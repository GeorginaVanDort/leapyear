##Description
This site allows users to test whether a year is a leap year.


##Specs

  _Input Example: 2000_
  _Output Example: true_

**The program should return 'false' for years divisible by 100, since those are not leap years.**
    _Input Example: 1900_
    _Output Example: false_

**The program should return 'false' for non-years.**
  _Input Example: ABCD or $%!#_
  _Output Example: false "Please enter a year"_

**The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 4, since those are leap years.**
  _Input Example: 2004_
